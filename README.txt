This repository is where I store latex based content for my knowledge graph

It has scripts to push to a specific knowledge graph which is hosted on kgbase.

In order to use those scripts you will need python-dotenv and pythong-kgbase.

If you would like to see this knowledge graph or join it you may contact me.
