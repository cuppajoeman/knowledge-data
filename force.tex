\begin{defn*}{Force}
  A force is any interaction that, when unopposed will change the motion of an object. A force could cause an object with mass to change it's velocity, that is, to accelerate. Force is a vector as it measures both magnitude and direction. It is measured in newtons and is denoted by $F$
