\begin{deduction*}{Scalar Times Vector is Zero implies one of them Zero}
  Suppose that $ a \in \mathbb{F}, v \in V$, and that $ av = 0$ we will prove that 
  \[
  a =  0 \in \mathbb{F} \text{ or } v = 0 \in V
  \]
  \begin{pf}
    Supposing $ a \neq 0$, then by multiplying both sides by $\frac{1}{a}$ we obtain 
    \[
    v = \left( \frac{1}{a} \right)0 = 0 \in \mathbb{F}
    \]
    by compatibility of scalar multiplication, and the fact that any scalar times the identity element is still the identity. Otherwise $ a = 0$ and the proof is done.
  \end{pf}
