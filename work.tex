\begin{defn*}{Work}
Work is the energy transferred to or from an object via the application of force along a displacement. If the force $F$ is constant and the angle between the force and the displacement $s$ is $\theta$, then the work done is given by 
\[
W = F  \cdot  s  \cdot  \cos  \left( \theta \right)  \in \mathbb{R}
\]
The unit for work is the joule.
\end{defn*}
