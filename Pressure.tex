\begin{defn*}{Pressure}
  Pressure is the force aplied perpendicular to the surface of an object per unit area over which that force is distributed. The SI unit for pressure is the pascal.

  \subsubsection*{Examples}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If you press your finger against a wall, it's unlikely that you could break through. If you exert the same force but now pushing on a thumbtack, it would be much easier to poke a hole throught the wall as the thumbtack applies more pressure, because the the forces is distributed into a smaller area..
  \end{itemize}
