Given two sets <math>A_1, A_2</math>their union is given by:

<math display="block">A_1 \cup A_2  \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \{x : x \in A \text{ or } x \in B \}</math>

The definition can be expanded to more than two sets as follows:<math display="block">\bigcup_{1 \le i \le n}A_{i} \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \bigcup_{i=1}^{n}A_{i} \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \dotsb \cup A_n =\left\{ x: x \in A_{i} \text{ for some  } i \in \left[ n \right] \right\}</math>

== Remarks ==

* Notice that there is no bracketing in the expanded version of the union, we don't use any bracketing, this is allowed since we have proven that the union is associative
