== Proof ==

* To prove that these two numbers are equal, we start with the fact that the left hand side simply counts the number elements in the set $\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} X_{i}$, to show that that the number on the right hand side is equal to that, we will also show that it counts the number of elements in the set $\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} X_{i}$.
** Let $a \in  \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} X_{i}$, if this is the case then there exists $X_{\alpha_{1}}, X _{\alpha_{2}} \ldots X_{\alpha_{k}}, X_{\beta_{1}}, X _{\beta{_2}} \ldots X_{\beta_{o}} $ such that $a \in X_{\alpha_{1}} \cap X _{\alpha_{2}} \cap \dotsb \cap X_{\alpha_{k}}  $and $a \not\in X_{\beta_{1}} \cap X _{\beta_{2}} \cap \dotsb \cap X_{\beta_{o}}  $
*** If this is the case then the sum $\sum_{i=1}^{n} N\left(X_{i}\right)$ over counts $a$ $\alpha_{k}$ times, this is because $a$ counted for each $X_{\alpha_{j}}$, as $a \in X_{\alpha_{j}}$
*** We consider the following sum $\sum_{0 \le i_{1} < i_{2} \le n} N\left(X_{i_{1}} \cap X_{i_{2}}\right)$. We know that $a \in X_{\alpha_{j}} \cap X_{\alpha_{l}}$ for any $\alpha_{j}, \alpha_{l} \in \left\{ \alpha_{1} , \alpha_{2} , \dotsc  , \alpha_{k - 1} , \alpha_{k} \right\} $. We notice that the number of ways to choose two elements from the set $\left\{ \alpha_{1} , \alpha_{2} , \dotsc  , \alpha_{k - 1} , \alpha_{k} \right\}$ is simply $\binom{a_{k}}{2}$thus this represents the number of times that $a$ was over counted by this sum. Notice that we are subtracting this number.
**** Also note that if we must choose two elements from $\left\{ \alpha_{1} , \alpha_{2} , \dotsc  , \alpha_{k - 1} , \alpha_{k} \right\}$, as if we had chosen at least one from $\left\{ \beta_{1} , \beta_{2} , \dotsc  , \beta_{o - 1} , \beta_{o} \right\}$, then $a \not\in X_{\circ} \cap X_{\beta_t}$
*** Following the same logic, we see that if $a \in X_{\alpha_{j}} \cap X_{\alpha_{l}} \cap X_{\alpha_{m}}$ then the third summation will over count $\binom{\alpha_{k}}{3}$ times.
*** Thus the $i$-th sum will over count $\binom{\alpha_{k}}{i}$ times.
* Now to see how many times the right hand side counts $a$ we will simply sum all of the ways it counts it (taking into account the subtractions and additions like in the original summation) to see that it looks like:

\[
	\sum_{i=1}^{\alpha_k} \left( -1 \right) ^{i  +  1} \binom{a_{k}}{i}
\]

* Recall that the binomial theorem tells us about a sum starting from $0$, namely that

\[
	\left( x  +  y \right) ^{\alpha_k}= \sum_{i=0}^{\alpha_k} \binom{\alpha_k}{i} x ^{i} y ^{\alpha_k -i} 
\]

* We attempt to manipulate this sum to answer our question about how many times the right hand side counts $a$. By letting $x = -1, y = 1$ we see that

\[
	0 = \sum_{i=0}^{\alpha_k} \left( -1 \right) ^{i} \binom{\alpha_k}{i} = 1  + \sum_{i=1}^{\alpha_k} \left( -1 \right) ^{i} \binom{\alpha_k}{i} \Leftrightarrow 1 = \sum_{i=1}^{\alpha_k} \left( -1 \right) ^{i  +  1} \binom{\alpha_k}{i}
\]

Therefore the right hand side of only counts $a$ once, as required.
