<math display="block">\sum_{i=0}^{n} \binom{n}{i}= 2^{n}</math>

== Proof idea ==
They both count the number of strings of the set <math display="inline">\left\{ 0, 1 \right\}^{n}</math> right hand side: trivial left hand side: partition based on number of zero's in the string.

You can also prove it from the binomial theorem subbing in x = y = 1
