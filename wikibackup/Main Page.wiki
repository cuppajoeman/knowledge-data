== Purpose ==

* To emphasize "why" rather than "what", the goal is to to be able to learn from these pages
* To obtain information easily and through a hierarchical manner
* To have short and concise pages, that are linked between each other
* To store interesting problems, and their solutions for practice

== Editing ==

* [[mediawikiwiki:Cheatsheet|Learn the syntax]]
*[[wikipedia:Help:Displaying_a_formula|Learn the extent of the <nowiki><math> tags</nowiki>]]

=== Tools ===
*[https://mathpix.com/ Convert Images to LaTeX]
* Convert LaTeX into mediwiki syntax:
**<code>pandoc -t mediawiki scratch.tex | xclip -sel clip</code> then paste into the source editor
** For the savvy, make a binding in your editor of choice
*** vim: <code>map <leader>ltm :%w !pandoc -t mediawiki \| xclip -sel clip<CR></code>
=== Aesthetics ===

* Formatting
** If you'd rather view math as mathml, then it is recommended to use Firefox with the [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/native-mathml/ mathml extension] (as chrome based browser do not support it)

* Dark Theme
** If you are in a browser which supports chrome extensions, then I would recommend installing [https://darkreader.org/help/en/ dark reader]
*** Without styling math images will show up as dark on dark, and will not be inverted, though this happens on wikipedia
*** Go to the dev tools, which will open up a huge CSS file, we will steal the styling from wikipedia. 
**** Find wikipedia's styling, copy in a new entry and change the website name to keepaskingwhy.com
== Future ==

* Ordering content by their knowledge dependencies
