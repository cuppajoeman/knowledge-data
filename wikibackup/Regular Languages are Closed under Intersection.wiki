The class of regular languages is closed under the union operation. That is if <math display="inline">A_{1}, A_{2}</math> are regular languages, so is <math display="inline">A_{1} \cap A_{2}</math>

{{Proof|content=
* First follow the proof of the closure under union, we only modify the construction as follows:
*<math display="inline">F</math> is defined to be the set of pairs such that both members are in an accepting state of <math display="inline">M_{1}</math>, <math display="inline">M_{2}</math>, in other words <math display="block">F = \left( F_{1} \times F_{2} \right)</math>
}}
