Given two sets $A$, $B$ the Cartesian product of $A$ and $B$ written as $A\times B$ is the set
\[
	\left\{ \left( a, b \right): a \in A, b \in B \right\}
\]
----Note: 
\[
	\left( A \times B \right) \times C \cap A \times \left( B \times C \right) = \emptyset
\] (create a question for when this is not the case) as an element from the left hand side would have the form $\left( \left( \cdot, \cdot \right), \cdot \right)$ and  the one on the right $\left( \cdot, \left( \cdot, \cdot \right) \right)$ but they are functionally the same if you were to remove all inner tuples.

== Notation ==
Additionally, for a given set $X$ we may write $X^{n}$ to represent the set $\left\{ \left( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{n-1}, x_{n} \right): \forall i \in \left[ n \right], x_{i} \in X \right\}$, the notation is suggestive of 
\[
	\underbrace{X \times X \times \ldots \times X}_{n\text{ times }}
\] even though elements from this set would have many nested inner tuples, which do not need to be considered.
