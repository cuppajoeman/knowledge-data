== Fundamental Properties ==

* In nearly all musical traditions there is a unifying feature, namely a way to recognize two frequencies as being equivalent to each other
* A partition into equal sizes of the frequencies between any frequency and the closest frequency which is equivalent
* A single note which will generate all the others using the above two properties.

== Generalized Construction ==

* Let two frequencies be equal if they differ by a multiple of <math>c \in \mathbb{R}</math>, we denote this as the '''equivalence ratio'''
* Let us partition the frequencies between any two closest equivalent frequencies into <math>m \in \mathbb{N}</math> parts
** The distance between any two frequencies shall be called an '''atomic unit'''
* Let <math>b \in \mathbb{R}</math> be a single note in our system, we call <math>b</math> the '''base frequency'''
* Using the above rules, the set of all possible pitches that can be played is as follows, and we will denote this as a '''musical system'''<math display="block">\mathcal{N}\left(b, c, m \right) = \{ b \cdot c^{\frac{k}{m}} : k \in \mathbb{Z} \}</math>

== Western Construction ==

* In the above generalized construction we set concrete values as <math display="block">\mathbb{W} \stackrel{\mathtt{D}}{ = } \mathcal{N}\left(440\text{Hz}, 2, 12 \right) = \{ 440\text{Hz} \cdot 2^{\frac{k}{12}} : k \in \mathbb{Z} \}</math>

== Notation ==

*Although this is completely correct, going up to a musician and asking them to play <math>440\text{Hz}\cdot 2 ^{\frac{-39}{12}}</math>isn't really possible. And anyways, that notation is quite unwieldy
*Also, on the antipodal stance, if someone asks you to play the note A, then this is not enough information either, which A shall we play
* TODO: Show the notation I use which is integer notation with octave band

== Styles ==
* Jazz [TODO]
