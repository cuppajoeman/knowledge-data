An algorithm is similar to a process, routine, technique, method and so on, though it has some defining features

# Finite: The algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps
#* And for practical application it should require a very finite number, one that is reasonable. One that does not take a humans lifetime or more to complete 
# Definite: Each step of the algorithm is precisely defined
# Input: Quantities that are given to it before the algorithm begins, or dynamically as it is running
# Output: Quantities that have a specified relation to the inputs
# Effective: It's operations must be sufficiently basic so that they can in principle be done exactly and in a finite length of time by someone using pen and paper
#* An example of a non effective step: 
#** If 4 is the largest integer <math>n</math> for which there is a solution to the equation <math>w^n + x^n + y^n = z^n</math> for positive integers <math>w, x, y, z</math>, then go to step N
#** Note: It would become effective if someone had constructed an algorithm to verify the above statement.
