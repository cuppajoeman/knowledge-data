* First we define the following function <math>P: \mathbb{F} \to \mathbb{G}</math>, defined as <math>(s(n), f(n)) \mapsto n</math> 
** One way to think of this function is by <math>P</math>lucking the strings, you map a note on the fret board to a frequency
----Initial Observations

* When you increase by a fret you move up by a semitone:<math display="block">P (s(n), f(n)+1) = 2^{\frac{1}{12}} \cdot P(s(n), f(n))</math>

----
* By construction of the guitar (namely the number of semitones between strings) we have the following equalities 
**<math>\forall i \in \{ 6, 5, 4, 2 \}, I (P(i, 0), P(i-1,0)) = 5</math>
**<math>I(P(4,0), P(3,0)) = 4</math>
** Or written another way:
***<math>\forall i \in \{ 6, 5, 4, 2 \}, P(i, 5) = P(i - 1,0)</math>
***<math>P(4,4) = P(3,0)</math>
----
* The function is not invective (You can play the same note in many ways)
** This is true because of the following simple counter example
***<math>(6,5) \mapsto A</math>
***<math>(5,0) \mapsto A</math>
