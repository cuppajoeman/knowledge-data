A person is standing on the border between the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, facing Quebec, with a bag containing <math>n</math> green balls and <math>n</math> red balls. 

* He draws a ball randomly from the bag. If the ball is green, he makes one step forward towards Quebec. If it is red, he makes one step backward towards Ontario. He repeats the process until no balls are left (the balls are not replaced in the bag). What is the probability that he visits Quebec?

To be clear:
* All steps (forward or backward) are exactly of the same distance and lie on a straight line perpendicular to the border.

* Being on the border does not count as visiting Quebec.

== Solution ==
* We appeal to the question Graph on <math>\mathbb{N}</math>, by calling <math>\mathbb{\mathbb{Z}} ^{\le 0} </math> Quebec, and <math>\mathbb{N} ^{\ge 1} </math> as Ontario. 
* For any sequence of balls chosen such that you do not visit Quebec, say <math>b_{1}, b_{2},  \dots ,b_{n - 1},b_{n} </math>  where <math>b_{i} \in \left\{ \text{ red, green }  \right\} </math>, we can map this to the graph generated by moving right one unit when the ball is red and left one unit when the ball is green, so by the question we obtain that the total number of ways to not visit Quebec is <math>C_{n} </math>.

* Recall that  we have <math>2n</math> balls in total, and each one being one of two colors, so there will be <math>2^{2n} </math> different walks, because of this there will be <math>2^{2n} - C_{n} </math>  ways to visit Quebec

* Thus the probability of visiting Quebec is <math display="block">1 - \frac{C_{n} }{2^{2n} } </math>
