A collection of distinct objects. The objects are called its elements or members. Sets may be described formally in many ways


One method is to list the elements directly inside braces, we have:
\[
	S = \{ 7, 21, 57 \}
\]Another method is to describe how the elements shall be constructed:
\[
	S = \{x: x \text{ is even }\}
\]
