Let <math display="inline">A</math> and <math display="inline">B</math> be languages. We define the regular operations as follows:

* Union: <math display="inline">A \cup B = \left\{ x : x \in A \text{ or } x \in B \right\}</math>
* Concatenation: <math display="inline">A \circ B = \left\{ xy : x \in A \text{ and } y \in B \right\}</math>
* Star: <math display="inline">A^{*} = \left\{ x_{1}x_{2}\ldots x_{k}: k \ge 0 \text{ and each } x_{i} \in A\right\}</math>

== Remarks ==

* The star operation is a unary operation on a single language, since <math>k = 0</math> is a possibility this injects <math>\varepsilon</math>, no matter if the original language had it

== Examples ==

* <math>\Sigma = \{\texttt{a, b, c, ..., z} \}</math>, <math>A = \{ \texttt{juice}, \texttt{berry}\}</math> and <math>B = \{ \texttt{box}, \texttt{crate} \}</math>
** <math>A \cup B = \{ \texttt{juice}, \texttt{berry}, \texttt{box}, \texttt{crate} \}</math>
** <math>A \circ B = \{ \texttt{juicebox},\texttt{juicecrate} \texttt{berrybox}, \texttt{berrycrate} \}</math>
** <math display="block">A^*= \{ \varepsilon, \texttt{juice},\texttt{berry}, \texttt{juicejuice}, \texttt{juiceberry} \texttt{berryberry},\texttt{berryjuice} \texttt{juicejuicejuice}, \texttt{juicejuiceberry}, \texttt{juiceberryjuice}, \texttt{juiceberryberry}, ... \}</math>
