Consider an experiment whose outcomes is not predictable with certainty in advance, but suppose that the set of all possible outcomes is known. Then the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment is known as the sample space of the experiment and is denoted by <math display="inline">S</math>.

== Examples ==
* An experiment where we determine the sex of a newborn child then <math display="block">S = \left\{ \mathtt{girl}, \mathtt{boy} \right\}</math>
* An experiment consisting of flipping two coins: <math display="block">S = \left\{ \left( H,H \right), \left( H, T \right), \left( T, H \right), \left( T, T \right) \right\}</math> Where the <math display="inline">i</math>-th entry of the tuple represents the outcome of the <math display="inline">i</math>-th toss
* The experiment consisting of the measurement of the lifespan of a human in years<math display="block">S = \mathbb{R} ^{\ge 0}</math> (Where we live in a world where a human may live to any age)
