* A [[relation]] from a set of inputs to a set of possible outputs where each input is related to exactly one output. In other words a function $f$ is a set of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ such that for any $x,y,z$ if we have $(x,y) \in f$ and $(x,z) \in f$, then we must have $y = z$.

== Examples ==
* $\{ (2, 4), (-2, 4) \}$ is a function
* $\{ (4, 2), (4, -2) \}$ is not a function
