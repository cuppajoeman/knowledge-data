The betweenness of an edge is how many shortest paths travel through it

For every pair of nodes A,B, we say there is one unit of “flow” along the edges from A to B

Flow between A to B divides evenly among all shortest paths from A to B

If there are k shortest paths that uses edge (A,B), 1/k flows through each of these k shortest paths
