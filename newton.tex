\begin{defn*}{Newton}
  One newton is the force needed to accelerate one kilogram of mass at the rate of one meter per second squared in the direction of the applied force.\\
  Note that meter per second squared is the change in velocity per time unit. If you measure the masses velocity it would be increasing by one meter per second every second
