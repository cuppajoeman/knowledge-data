\begin{property*}{Cartesian Product is not Associative}
  When $A, B, C$ such that each one has at least one element, we have that
\[
	\left( A \times B \right) \times C \cap A \times \left( B \times C \right) = \emptyset
\] 

\begin{pf}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item An element from the left hand side would have the form $\left( \left( \cdot, \cdot \right), \cdot \right)$ and  the one on the right $\left( \cdot, \left( \cdot, \cdot \right) \right)$, thus there is no element in both the right hand side and left hand side.
  \end{itemize}
\end{pf}
  \subsubsection*{Remark}
   They are functionally the same if you were to ignore all inner tuples. Eg, when we talk about $R ^{3}$ it doesn't matter if we are talking about $ \left( R \times R \right) \times R$ or $ R \times \left( R \times R \right)$ we are simply talking about the set of all triples involving elements from $R$
