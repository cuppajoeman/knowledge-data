\begin{defn*}{Euclidean Algorithm}

Given two positive integers $m$ and $n$ find their greatest common divisor, that is, the largest positive integer that evenly divides both $m$ and $n$.

\begin{enumerate}
  # Divide $m$ by $n$ and let $r$ be the remainder where $0 \le r < n$
  # If $r =0$, the algorithm terminates; $n$ is the answer.
  # Set $m \leftarrow n$, $n \leftarrow r$ and return to step 1
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Algorithm} Euclid_Alg \textbf{is}
  \textbf{inputs}: $ n, m$ 
  r $\leftarrow m ~\%~ n$ 
  \textbf{if} r $ = 0$ \textbf{then}
    return r
  \textbf{end}
  return Euclid_Alg($ n, r $)
\textbf{end Algorithm} Euclid_Alg \textbf{is}

\section*{Correctness}
\begin{pf}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Note that by the GCD invariant we have: $\gcd(m,n) = \gcd(n,r)$, then each time we go to step 3 this chain of equalities would expand by one
    \itemTo see why we would be applying the quotient remainder theorem on $n$ in the next iteration to obtain $n = q n_1 + r_1$, then we would have 
    \[
      \gcd(n,m) = \gcd(n,r) = \gcd(n_1, r_1)
    \]
    \item After finitely many iterations our algorithm get to the second step (read the termination proof) and say it's called with $n_t, r_t$ ($t$ for termination)
    \item It's in the second step so  $r_t = 0$ and $n_t = \gcd(n_t,0) = \gcd(n_t, r_t) = ... \gcd(n_1, r_1) = \gcd(n, r) = gcd(m,n)$ (the chain of equalities) 
    \item Our output would be $n_t = \gcd(n,m)$, as required.
  \end{itemize}
\end{pf}

\section*{Termination}

The program terminates if $r = 0$, the value of $n$ decreases by at least 1 after each iteration specified by the strict inequality from the quotient remainder theorem, therefore if $n_k$ is the value of $n$ after $k$ iterations then $n_0, n_1, ...$ is a decreasing sequence of positive integers, and so it must be finite, therefore there is a $r \in \mathbb{N}$ such that the algorithm terminates on iteration $r$ (as $n_r = 0$)
