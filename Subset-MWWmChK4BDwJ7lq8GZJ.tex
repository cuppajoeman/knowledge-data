\begin{defn*}{Subset}
Given two sets $A,B$, we say that $A$ is a subset of $B$ when any element of $A$ is also in $B$. In this case we write 
\[
A \subseteq B
\]

We say that $A$ is a proper subset of $B$ when $A$ is a subset of $B$, but $A \neq B$, in other words there is an element in $B$ which is not in $A$
\end{defn*}
